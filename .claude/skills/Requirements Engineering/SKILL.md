# Requirements Engineering

This skill provides patterns for translating natural language user prompts into structured requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, and automatically generated beads tasks.

## 1. User Story Format Detection

### Standard Format

```
As a [actor/role]
I want [feature/capability]
So that [business benefit/value]
```

### Extraction Logic

**Pattern Matching**:
```bash
# Detect "As a/an" → Actor
ACTOR=$(echo "$prompt" | grep -ioE "as an? [a-z ]+" | sed 's/as an? //')

# Detect "I want" → Feature
FEATURE=$(echo "$prompt" | grep -ioE "i want [^.]*" | sed 's/i want //')

# Detect "So that" → Benefit
BENEFIT=$(echo "$prompt" | grep -ioE "so that [^.]*" | sed 's/so that //')
```

**Structured Output**:
```markdown
## User Story

**As a** developer
**I want** JWT authentication with refresh tokens
**So that** users can securely log in and stay authenticated

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can log in with email and password
- [ ] JWT access token is generated on successful login
- [ ] Refresh token is provided for token renewal
- [ ] Access token expires after 15 minutes
- [ ] Refresh token expires after 7 days
```

---

## 2. Given/When/Then Format

### BDD Acceptance Criteria

```
Given [initial context/precondition]
When [action/event occurs]
Then [expected outcome/result]
```

### Extraction

```bash
# Extract Given/When/Then if present
if echo "$prompt" | grep -qiE "given|when|then"; then
  echo "$prompt" | grep -ioE "(given|when|then) [^.]*" >> requirements.md
fi
```

**Example**:
```
Given a registered user
When they enter valid credentials
Then they receive a JWT access token and refresh token
And the access token expires in 15 minutes
```

---

## 3. Feature Request Parsing

### Keywords Detection

**Action Verbs** (indicate feature type):

| Verb | Feature Type | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Implement/Build/Create | New Feature | "Implement user authentication" |
| Add/Include | Enhancement | "Add email notifications" |
| Fix/Debug | Bug Fix | "Fix login error" |
| Refactor/Cleanup | Refactoring | "Refactor payment service" |
| Optimize/Improve | Performance | "Optimize database queries" |

### Component Extraction

**Pattern**: "with X and Y"

```bash
# Extract "with X and Y" patterns
COMPONENTS=$(echo "$prompt" | grep -ioE "with [a-z, and]+" | sed 's/with //' | tr ',' '\n')
```

**Example**:
```
Input: "Add JWT authentication with refresh tokens and email verification"

Components:
- refresh tokens
- email verification
```

### Technology Constraints

**Pattern**: "using Z"

```bash
# Extract technology constraints
TECH=$(echo "$prompt" | grep -ioE "using [a-z ]+" | sed 's/using //')
```

**Example**:
```
Input: "Build payment system using Stripe"

Technology: Stripe
```

### Target Audience

**Pattern**: "for A"

```bash
# Extract target audience
AUDIENCE=$(echo "$prompt" | grep -ioE "for [a-z ]+" | sed 's/for //')
```

---

## 4. Task Breakdown

### Automatic Subtask Creation

**Strategy**: Break feature into technical layers

```
1. Database Layer (migrations, schema changes)
2. Model Layer (ActiveRecord models, validations)
3. Service Layer (business logic, external APIs)
4. Controller Layer (HTTP endpoints, routing)
5. View/Component Layer (UI, Hotwire components)
6. Testing Layer (RSpec tests, coverage)
```

### Example Breakdown

**User Story**: "Add JWT authentication with refresh tokens"

**Epic**: AUTH-001 - JWT Authentication System

**Subtasks**:
```
AUTH-002: Add User authentication columns (DB)
├─ Migration: add_auth_columns_to_users
├─ Columns: password_digest, refresh_token, token_expires_at
└─ Dependencies: None

AUTH-003: Implement JWT token generation (Model)
├─ User model: generate_jwt_token, generate_refresh_token
├─ Token expiration logic
└─ Dependencies: AUTH-002

AUTH-004: Create AuthService for login/refresh (Service)
├─ AuthService.login(email, password)
├─ AuthService.refresh_token(refresh_token)
├─ AuthService.verify_token(jwt)
└─ Dependencies: AUTH-003

AUTH-005: Add authentication endpoints (Controller)
├─ POST /auth/login
├─ POST /auth/refresh
├─ POST /auth/logout
└─ Dependencies: AUTH-004

AUTH-006: Add RSpec tests (Testing)
├─ Model tests for token generation
├─ Service tests for auth flow
├─ Controller tests for endpoints
└─ Dependencies: AUTH-005
```

### Dependency Detection

Identify dependencies automatically:

```
Database → Models (models depend on schema)
Models → Services (services use models)
Services → Controllers (controllers call services)
Controllers → Views (views render from controllers)
All layers → Tests (tests validate each layer)
```

## 5. Beads Task Creation

### create-beads-tasks.sh Integration

**Workflow**:

1. Extract requirements from `.claude/extracted-requirements.md`
2. Create epic with full description
3. Parse acceptance criteria
4. Generate subtasks with dependencies
5. Store epic ID for workflow

**Implementation**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# create-beads-tasks.sh

# Parse requirements file
REQUIREMENTS_FILE=".claude/extracted-requirements.md"

# Create epic
EPIC_ID=$(bd create \
  --type epic \
  --title "$FEATURE_TITLE" \
  --description "$(cat $REQUIREMENTS_FILE)")

# Parse acceptance criteria (lines starting with - or numbers)
grep -E "^-|^[0-9]+\." "$REQUIREMENTS_FILE" | while read -r criterion; do
  # Clean criterion (remove leading markers)
  criterion=$(echo "$criterion" | sed 's/^[- 0-9.]*//')

  if [ -n "$criterion" ]; then
    # Create subtask
    TASK_ID=$(bd create \
      --type task \
      --title "$criterion" \
      --priority 2 \
      --deps "$EPIC_ID")

    echo "Created task: $TASK_ID - $criterion"
  fi
done

# Store epic ID
echo "$EPIC_ID" > .claude/current-epic.txt
```

---

## 6. Intent Classification

### Multi-level Filtering

**Level 1**: Action Verb Detection

```bash
# Feature indicators
if echo "$prompt" | grep -qiE "add|implement|build|create"; then
  intent="feature"
  confidence="high"
fi

# Debug indicators
if echo "$prompt" | grep -qiE "fix|debug|troubleshoot|error"; then
  intent="debug"
  confidence="high"
fi

# Refactor indicators
if echo "$prompt" | grep -qiE "refactor|cleanup|optimize|restructure"; then
  intent="refactor"
  confidence="medium"
fi
```

**Level 2**: Context Analysis

```bash
# Check for domain context (Rails-specific)
if echo "$prompt" | grep -qiE "model|controller|migration|activerecord"; then
  context="rails"
fi

# Check for technical details
if echo "$prompt" | grep -qiE "jwt|oauth|api|rest"; then
  technical_context="authentication"
fi
```

**Level 3**: Complexity Scoring

```bash
# Word count
word_count=$(echo "$prompt" | wc -w)

if [ $word_count -gt 20 ]; then
  complexity="high"  # Complex feature request
elif [ $word_count -gt 10 ]; then
  complexity="medium"  # Standard feature
else
  complexity="low"  # Simple task
fi
```

## 10. Best Practices

### User Story Writing

**Good**:
```
As a customer
I want to save my payment method
So that I can checkout faster on future purchases
```

**Bad**:
```
Add payment saving
```

### Acceptance Criteria

**Good** (Specific, Testable):
```
- User can add credit card
- Card is validated before saving
- Card number is masked in UI (only last 4 digits shown)
- Saved cards appear in checkout dropdown
```

**Bad** (Vague):
```
- Payment should work
- Cards are saved
```

### Component Extraction

**Good** (Granular):
```
- JWT token generation
- Refresh token rotation
- Token blacklisting
- Email verification
```

**Bad** (Too broad):
```
- Authentication
```

## 11. Integration with Smart Detection

### detect-intent.sh Enhancement

Add requirements extraction call:

```bash
# In detect-intent.sh (after intent scoring)

# Extract requirements
if extract_requirements "$USER_PROMPT"; then
  # Create beads tasks if enabled
  AUTO_CREATE=$(grep '^auto_create_beads_tasks:' .claude/reactree-rails-dev.local.md | sed 's/.*: *//')

  if [ "$AUTO_CREATE" = "true" ]; then
    bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/scripts/create-beads-tasks.sh "$USER_PROMPT"
  fi
fi
```
